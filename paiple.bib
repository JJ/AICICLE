abstract="Personal Learning Environments (PLEs) represent a paradigm shift in the educational field. PLEs empower learners to take more ownership of their learning and to be successful lifelong learners. In the digital era, the development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) makes Personalized Learning (PL) possible, which is a major step toward the implementation of Personalized Learning Environments at all levels of education. Through tailoring the design to students' personal strengths, weaknesses, and interests, PLEs are gradually gaining ground in applied degree education. However, being new educational approaches, PLEs should start from K-12 and go through lifelong education. This study tried to investigate the status quo of PLEs and PL applications in primary and secondary schools worldwide, especially in the U.S., the U.K., and mainland China. Through literature review, the study analyzed the main challenges of PLEs implementation and predicted its future development. It was suggested that future research in PLEs and PL should focus on systematic reforms rather than single or limited variable interventions.",

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic caused the flaws of traditional grading systems to become even more apparent. In response, a growing number of educators are transitioning their classrooms to focus on alternative methods of assessment. These subversive methods promote more equitable assessments, as they provide a more accurate picture of what a student has learned, cultivate students' intrinsic motivation, and do not privilege students from certain backgrounds. This article details how alternative grading, specifically "ungrading," was integrated into an introductory data science course. I detail how the course components align with the principles of alternative grading, students' responses to the course structure, and the lessons I learned along the way. Finally, I close with a discussion of how infusing alternative methods of assessment into the classroom stands to cultivate the diversity continually lacking in computer science and data science.},
