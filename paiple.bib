PLEs empower learners to take more ownership of their learning and to be successful lifelong learners. In the digital era, the development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) makes Personalized Learning (PL) possible, which is a major step toward the implementation of Personalized Learning Environments at all levels of education. Through tailoring the design to students' personal strengths, weaknesses, and interests, PLEs are gradually gaining ground in applied degree education. However, being new educational approaches, PLEs should start from K-12 and go through lifelong education. This study tried to investigate the status quo of PLEs and PL applications in primary and secondary schools worldwide, especially in the U.S., the U.K., and mainland China. Through literature review, the study analyzed the main challenges of PLEs implementation and predicted its future development. It was suggested that future research in PLEs and PL should focus on systematic reforms rather than single or limited variable interventions.",

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic caused the flaws of traditional grading systems to become even more apparent. In response, a growing number of educators are transitioning their classrooms to focus on alternative methods of assessment. These subversive methods promote more equitable assessments, as they provide a more accurate picture of what a student has learned, cultivate students' intrinsic motivation, and do not privilege students from certain backgrounds. This article details how alternative grading, specifically "ungrading," was integrated into an introductory data science course. I detail how the course components align with the principles of alternative grading, students' responses to the course structure, and the lessons I learned along the way. Finally, I close with a discussion of how infusing alternative methods of assessment into the classroom stands to cultivate the diversity continually lacking in computer science and data science.},

Objective. The purpose of this review is to discuss some principles from cognitive psychology regarding the benefits of testing and translate those findings into practical applications for instruction and studying. Findings. Testing or retrieval practice is superior to re-study for promoting long-term retention. The benefits of testing can be see with open-ended responses (eg, cued or free recall) and multiple choice questions. The use of multiple-choice questions during testing may have an additional benefit as it may stabilize information that is stored in memory but temporarily inaccessible due to disuse (eg, marginal knowledge). Summary. Testing can have multiple learning benefits. We emphasize that incorporating opportunities for retrieval after teaching is an essential component of lasting learning. In addition, retrieval practice can be incorporated in all aspects of instruction.}

abstract = {The agile manifesto provides a framework for software development in which customer comes first. Here we will describe a teaching experience based on agile principles that puts students at the center of a strategy that, through the use of fit learning analytics, is able to optimize the potential of a class and its individual students. We used project-based learning and formative evaluation as agile teaching best practices, evaluating student progress based on learning objectives submitted and evaluated asynchronously. The time when every objective is submitted and the time taken to pass it are the essential data points that will be leveraged to evaluate class progress, and the impact of specific measures taken to improve it, in-class or from one course to the next. Measures taken through three years with the same methodology prove that agile teaching can work, but it needs measurements for diagnosis and subsequent interventions to reach its full potential.},
