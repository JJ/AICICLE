\section{PI's CV}

Juan J. Merelo Guervós was born on March 10, 1965. He obtained a degree in Physics (major in Theoretical Physics) by the university of Granada in 1988, and a PhD in Physics by the same university in 1994. He is currently registered as a student in a BA in Art history in the same university, starting in 2024-2025.

He is full professor at the Department of Computer Engineering, Automatics and Robotics at the University of Granada, position obtained in 2009. He started teaching at the same university, at the department then called Electronics and Computer Technology, in 1988, going through a tenured position as adjunct professor in 1991, and assistant professor in 1998. His teaching experience in higher education is, thus, 36 years at the moment.

He is also an experience free software developer, as well as performed consulting jobs for industry during all his career, latest one as Senior Software Engineer for the German startup polypoly from May 2021 to October 2022.

\subsection{Research}

An active researcher since 1988 as shown in his Google Scholar profile \url{https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gFxqc64AAAAJ}, this profile includes several hundreds of publications, an $h$ index of 43 and 222 publications with more than 10 citations (58 in the last 10 years). The total number of citations is close to 10000 (9689 at the time of writing). This shows a continuous commitment for excellence in research and development, and research interests in areas that are continuously relevant.

These areas include currently application of statistical techniques to the study of history, study of complex systems (an area where he has been studing continuously for the past 30 years), evolutionary algorithms (also dating back to his PhD, more than 30 years back), including lately application of green computing principles to evolutionary algorithms with the objective of reducing the amount of energy necessary for workloads that include this kind of algorithms. His research in the area of artificial intelligence goes back to 1993, when he started to use neural networks for predicting the secondary structure of proteins. The resulting paper, ``Evaluation of secondary structure of proteins from UV circular dichroism spectra using an unsupervised learning neural network'', was a keystone in bioinformatics research with 1301 citations at the time of writing, 13 of them last year.

The highlight of his research in complex networks is the paper ``A network analysis of the 2010 FIFA World Cup champion team play'', which in 2013 applied complex network analysis to the game of soccer. It has received 168 citations, 13 of them in the last year.

He has been an active principal investigator of research projects since 1997, including 3-year Spanish national research projects, as well as European funded research projects and capacity-building projects such as EduBots, researching the use of chatbots for improving the learning experience in higher education. As a result of this project, the paper ``Chatbots and messaging platforms in the classroom: An analysis from the teacher’s perspective'' was published and immediately received attention by the education research community, obtaining 14 citations in its first year in public.

During his career, he has given tutorials in many research conferences, mainly related to evolutionary algorithms: Parallel Problem Solving from Nature (PPSN), World Conference on Computational Intelligence (WCCI), General Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO). He has also been keynote speaker in conferences such as Evolutionary Computation Theory and Applications (ECTA), Intelligent Distributed Computing (IDC), GAMEON, Workshop on Engineering Applications (WEA), 1st International Conference on Artificial Intelligence: Theories and Applications (ICAITA), Annual Workshop on Software Engineering.

In general, his publication record reflect a steady career in research which is still ongoing, as well as a proved experience in the coordination and direction of research grants.

\subsection{Software development and engineering}

His experience in programming goes back to 1983, starting with BASIC, to proceed with Pascal. However, professional exposure to languages started with C and C++ in the early 90s, as well as Perl and Python; JavaScript in the late 90s. Later languages include professional proficiency in Raku and R, as well as some experience with Kotlin, Rust, Zig, Go and other languages like Ruby and Lua.
